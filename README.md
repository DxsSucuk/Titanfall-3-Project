# Titanfall-Project-With-BT
This is a Unity Game made to replicate the movement based shooter Titanfall 1 and 2.

# Multiplayer
The Multiplayer is under heavy development and does not fully work.<br>
For the multiplayer we have used Photon Fusion to get a simple yet capable networking system.

Known Issues:
- Special actions like jump and dash do not trigger sometimes.
- Movement is junky on clients.
- Titan Camera Y movement doesn't work.
