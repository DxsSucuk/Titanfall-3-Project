# Titanfall-Project-With-BT
This is a Unity Game made to replicate the movement based shooter Titanfall 1 and 2.

# Multiplayer
The Multiplayer is stil under heavy development and does not fully work.
For the multiplayer we use Photon Fusion to easily implement it and not having to deal with all the networking stuff.

Known Issues:
* Player does not respawn after leaving Titan.
* Shots are not synchronized
