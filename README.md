# Titanfall-Project-With-BT
This is a Unity Game made to replicate the movement based shooter Titanfall 1 and 2.

# Multiplayer
The Multiplayer is still under heavy development and does not fully work.
For the multiplayer we have used Photon Fusion to get a simple yet capable networking system

Known Issues:
- Special actions like jump and dash do not trigger sometimes.
