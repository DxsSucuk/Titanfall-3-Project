# Titanfall-3
This is a Unity Game made to replicate the movement based shooter Titanfall 1 and 2.

# Multiplayer
The Multiplayer is under heavy development and does not fully work.<br>
For the multiplayer we have used Photon Fusion to get a simple yet capable networking system.

Known Issues:
- Special actions like jump and dash do not trigger sometimes.
- Movement is janky on clients.
- Camera movement doesn't work.
- GunPlay fully broke in this fork.
