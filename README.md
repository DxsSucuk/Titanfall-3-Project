# Titanfall-3
This is a Unity Game made to replicate the movement based shooter Titanfall 1 and 2.

# Multiplayer
The Multiplayer is under heavy development and does not fully work.<br>
For the multiplayer we have used Photon Fusion to get a simple yet capable networking system.

Known Issues:
- Special actions like jump and dash do not trigger sometimes. (host)
- Special actions trigger to often on clients
- Camera Y doesn't work on clients and weird camera tilting.
